[Brief Introduction]
I am a graduate with a profound interest in Cybersecurity and a dedication to solving complex problems.


[About Me]
I am actively working towards my Cybersecurity Certificate, gaining technical skills in malware analysis, network defense, and data protection. Throughout my career, I’ve developed several key skills that align well with a role in cybersecurity.
First, I excel at conflict resolution, a skill I refined as a Physical Education Teacher. Managing conflicts among students and finding constructive solutions has been a daily task. In cybersecurity, resolving conflicts that arise from security incidents or between departments is crucial, and my experience positions me well for this aspect of the job.
Second, my communication skills have been a cornerstone of my roles as both a teacher and a Car Salesman. Whether explaining safety protocols to students or discussing vehicle features with customers, I’ve learned to communicate complex information clearly and effectively. This will be beneficial in cybersecurity when conveying technical information to non-technical staff. https://coursera.org/share/e7859bf30cf397d42310aa8f46c7c48a
